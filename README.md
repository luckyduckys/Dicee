# Dice Rolling App

The Dice Rolling App is a simple application that demonstrates knowledge of the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. It serves as a practical example for understanding this architectural pattern and how it can be implemented in modern app development.

## Features

- Simulates rolling a single or multiple dice.

- Randomly generates numbers between 1 and 6 for each dice roll.

- Clean separation of UI, logic, and data layers using MVVM.

## Tech Stack

- Platform: SwiftUI (Swift programming language)

- Architecture: MVVM
